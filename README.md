## üöÄ About Me

I'm a passionate researcher **_dedicated to integrating cutting-edge AI with cross-domain expertise to deliver practical, scalable, and high-impact applications_**. 

Currently, I am pursuing my MSc in Artificial Intelligence at Beihang University, where my work focuses on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), large language models (LLMs), and intelligent robotics. I received my Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence from Beihang University in 2019, graduating as an Outstanding Graduate.

I am actively seeking PhD positions focused on interdisciplinary and applied research. While my background is in AI and robotics, I am not limited to these fields‚ÄîI am especially interested in identifying a specific domain (such as healthcare, environmental science, or industrial automation) where I can leverage my AI expertise to drive meaningful, real-world impact. I welcome opportunities to collaborate across fields and apply advanced AI methods to solve real-world pressing challenges.
